      <h3>About me</h3>
<p>
As a kid, I always had two passions. Computers, and physical fitness. I enjoyed the challenges both physically and intellectually, 
and these passions have since carried over to my adult life. I was raised in a small town in the Catskills, where there are many more 
deer than there are people. Coming from a family that are mostly populated by engineers, doctors, and ex-military, I graduated from liberty 
high school, where I was initially planned on joining the Army. I wanted to originally be a doctor but, I came here to RIT where
 I trained as an army cadet and CSEC major instead. I found that studying for school and training full time ended up becoming an absolutely 
 grueling process. But it soon turned into something I was passionated about and absolutely loved.

Outside of classes I typically attend large hackathons pertinant to I/O based web applications. Specifically, I work with Node.js and comtemporary databases like MongoDB to build stunning single page applications for Wu Tang. I am Wu Tang's DBA and as such I handle the majority of the server side implementation, and anything related to the database. Through an RIT academic career I have dedicated my time to helping build stable web structures for Wu Tang. I also head the webinars here for meteor.js and site deployment.
