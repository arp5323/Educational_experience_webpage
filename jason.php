      <h3>About me</h3>
<p>
I'm Jason, 19 years of age and attending. RIT to become a professional in my field of IT. In my free time I like to play video games, 
hangout with friends, and play any recreational sport. I am currently in my sophomore year and am fully confident in tackling any obstacle 
that is in my way of obtaining a degree. Now that I have finally moved out of dorms and currently reside in an apartment, I will be able to 
focus more on motivating myself to do work on time and not get distracted by nonsense. I come from San Diego California where there is no 
water and is 75 and sunny every damn day. You either love it or hate it. Hint: Explains why I got to school in Rochester.
