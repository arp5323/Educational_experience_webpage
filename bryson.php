      <h3>About me</h3>
<p>I'm Bryson and I'm a computer security and Network and Systems Administration double major. I'm from Austin, Texas and this is my second year at RIT. 
I will swear by the fact that Austin is the best place in Texas and that Texas is a wonderful state. In general I really enjoy the networking and 
system admin side of IT. Security is also an interest of mine and I like including that within my networking projects and investigating the systems 
we use everyday and how secure they really are. I'm looking to land a research position in this soon.
