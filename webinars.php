            <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Source Development</h2>
            <p>Date: 12/2/2016<br>Price: $100<br>Prerequisites: Knowledge in one programming language</p>
            <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What you’ll learn</h3>
            <p>Open source isn’t some new fad or people giving away free products, but a community that supports development through global contribution. In this webinar you’ll learn about different open source licenses including GNU GPL, MIT License, and the FreeBSD license and how they protect your intellectual property. Along with how these licenses affect your development and open source projects, techniques for how to be a good contributor and build an open source community around a project will be discussed and shown in deployed projects.</p>
            <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why You Should Attend</h3>
            <p>Open source can be a powerful way to expand your development team through volunteer work just because people love your project! This is also encourages transparency, a sense of community, and gets a variety of views on your project. Being able to harness this power correctly isn’t the most straightforward and our webinar will be able to help you get your foot in the door with the open source community and show you how you can benefit from open source.</p>
