								Step 1: Get a github account. <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a>
								Github is one of the most popular platforms for sharing and managing projects open source or not and is a great place 
								to save your code. Having a github account will let you submit to a large amount of open source projects and submit your own pull requests.
								Next up is finding a project to work on. It would help if you are already familiar with the technology the project is using as you won't be 
								much help trying to help someone develop Java if all you know is python. Personally I head over to CodeTriage and sort by one of the languages I know. 
								One thing that is nice about CodeTriage is that it sorts nicely, but all the projects have descriptions so you can choose something you might 
								actually be interested in. The projects are also sorted by number of Issues on github, so you have a higher chance of finding a bug or feature 
								you can complete. Even if this isn’t your first time coding, finding something small to do just to get your foot in the door with a project and get 
								into the workflow process is a good idea. Simple as that! Start spreading yourself out on open source forums and check what might be trending on github 
								that day to find other projects to work on. If you get tired of one project look for something new or have a few projects so you always have something 
								to work on. After you’re familiar with the community, you could start a project of your own.
