                            Wu Tang Web solutions is known for being relentless in our drive forward to good web design. Our team is composed of six developers who each specialize in a variety of topics whose end goal is to make the web better. We do this by putting our knowledge
                            in the hands of people who either currently or plan on becoming web developers. But before we were Wu Tang Web Solutions we were six different students all studying for different majors at RIT. So how did these students with
                            a passion for web find each other? The answer is music. Every single one of us loves Hip Hop, specifically Wu Tang. After meeting at an on-campus event for Hip Hop Heads we got talking and realized that not only were we passionate
                            about Hip Hop, but also good web design. It felt like a natural fit to work together. Once we found out that our specialties in web design were so diverse yet we worked together so well we knew could start something great.
                            We finished our degrees and started Wu Tang Web Solutions as a web consultant company. Through the years we got a variety of clients and saw so many bad websites we almost had to quit the business. This constant barrage of
                            mediocrity did have one positive effective thought, it created an idea. The idea that we didnâ€™t have to be on the back foot constantly dealing with shoddy design if we could do something to prevent bad design from happening in
                            the first place.
