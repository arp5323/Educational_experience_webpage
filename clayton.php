      <h3>About me</h3>
<p>
My name is Clayton Brimm, I am a second year Web and Mobile Computing major at RIT. I grew up in Apple Creek Ohio, a small farm village near Akron. 
When I'm not diligently slaving over my class assignments you may find me playing videogames or watching films/TV. When I feel like breaking away from
 the bonds of modern technology you most likely will find me hanging out with friends, cooking, hiking, kayaking, staring at animals, reading, 
 listening to music, or doing random DIY projects. Iâ€™m very interested in Geographical Information System technologies and mobile development. 
 I love the idea of web design and I always am trying to increase my skills.
