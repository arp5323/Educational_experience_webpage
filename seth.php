      <h3>About me</h3>
<p>
My name is Seth Marcus and I am currently working on a degree for Human Centered Computing at RIT. Growing up I had a strong interest in both 
computers and design. My mother is an artist and had a powerful influence on how I see the world, always nudging me to look a little deeper, 
to learn why some choices in the world around us are made. My dad owned a tech company and would always have me help on electronics projects and 
trained me to think analytically. When I discovered the Human Centered Computing major it clicked in my mind, it was the perfect combination 
of what I had been taught growing up. I am currently learning to do web design with an aspiration to eventually be able to call myself 
a full stack developer.
