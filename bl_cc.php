								What cloud computing is not about is your hard drive. When you store data on or run programs from the hard drive, 
								that's called local storage and computing. Everything you need is physically close to you, which means accessing 
								your data is fast and easy, for that one computer, or others on the local network. Working off your hard drive is 
								how the computer industry functioned for decades; some would argue it's still superior to cloud computing, for reasons 
								I'll explain shortly. For it to be considered "cloud computing," you need to access your data or your programs over the
								Internet, or at the very least, have that data synced with other information over the Web. In a big business, you may know 
								all there is to know about what's on the other side of the connection but, as a user, you may never have any idea what 
								kind of massive data processing is happening on the other end. The end result is the same. With an online connection, 
								cloud computing can be done anywhere, anytime.
